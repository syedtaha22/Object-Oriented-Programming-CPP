# Abstract Classes and Interfaces

This module focuses on two advanced **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts in C++: **Abstract Classes** and **Interfaces**. These principles promote **design abstraction**, **code flexibility**, and **scalability** in large software systems.

## Topics Covered

1. **Abstract Classes**  
   - Purpose and use cases.  
   - Defining pure virtual functions.  
   - Abstract vs. concrete classes.  
   - Implementing partially defined behavior.  

2. **Interfaces in C++**  
   - Concept of interfaces in C++ using abstract classes.  
   - Designing contracts for derived classes.  
   - Multiple interface inheritance.  
   - Best practices for using interfaces in C++.  

## Folder Structure

- [AbstractClasses.md](AbstractClasses.md): Explanation of abstract classes, pure virtual functions, and their practical use cases.  
- [Interfaces.md](Interfaces.md): Guide on creating and using interfaces in C++ through abstract classes.  
- [examples/](examples/): Code examples demonstrating abstract classes, interfaces, and multiple inheritance scenarios.  
- [practice_questions/](practice_questions/): Exercises to practice abstract class and interface design patterns.  

This module builds on the foundations of **inheritance** and **polymorphism**, introducing you to techniques for writing **extensible**, **loosely coupled**, and **modular** object-oriented code.
