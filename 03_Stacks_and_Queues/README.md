# Stacks and Queues  

This module covers two fundamental **data structures**: **Stacks** and **Queues**. These structures are widely used for managing data in a **Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)** or **First-In-First-Out (FIFO)** manner.  

## Topics Covered  

1. **Stacks**  
   - Concept and real-world applications.  
   - Implementation using arrays and linked lists.  
   - Common operations: push, pop, peek, and isEmpty.  

2. **Queues**  
   - Concept and real-world applications.  
   - Implementation using arrays and linked lists.  
   - Common operations: enqueue, dequeue, front, and isEmpty.  

## Folder Structure  

- [Stacks.md](Stacks.md): Explanation of stacks, their working principle, and applications.
- [Resizing_Array_Stack.md](Resizing_Array_Stack.md): Implementation of a stack using a resizing array.
- [Linked_List_Stack.md](Linked_List_Stack.md): Implementation of a stack using a linked list.
- [Queues.md](Queues.md): Detailed overview of queues, including applications and operations.
- [Resizing_Array_Queue.md](Resizing_Array_Queue.md): Implementation of a queue using a resizing array.
- [Linked_List_Queue.md](Linked_List_Queue.md): Implementation of a queue using a linked list.
- [Linked_List_vs_Array_Stack_Queue.md](Linked_List_vs_Array_Stack_Queue.md): Detailed comparison of linked list and array-based implementations in terms of time complexity and memory usage. 
- [examples/](examples/): Code snippets demonstrating stacks and queues in C++.  
- [practice_questions/](practice_questions/): Exercises to reinforce the concepts.  

This module provides a structured approach to understanding **stacks** and **queues** and their applications in real-world scenarios.
