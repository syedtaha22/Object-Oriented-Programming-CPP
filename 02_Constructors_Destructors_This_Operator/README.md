# Constructors, Destructors, and the `this` Operator  

This module focuses on key **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in C++ that deal with object creation, destruction, and self-reference

## Topics Covered  

1. **Constructors**  
   - Default and parameterized constructors.  
   - Constructor overloading.  

2. **Copy Constructors**  
   - Deep copy vs. shallow copy.  
   - Implementing a custom copy constructor.
   - Overloading the assignment operator.

3. **The `this` Operator**  
   - Understanding `this` as a pointer to the current object.  
   - Common use cases, such as returning the current object from a method.  

4. **Destructors**  
   - Automatic resource management.  
   - When and why destructors are used.  

## Folder Structure  

- [Constructors.md](Constructors.md): Comprehensive guide to constructors, including types, usage, and best practices. 
- [Copy_Constructors.md](Copy_Constructors.md): Explanation of copy constructors, deep vs. shallow copy, and overloading the assignment operator. 
- [this_operator.md](this_operator.md): A deep dive into the `this` pointer and its applications.  
- [Destructors.md](Destructors.md): Explanation of destructors and their role in memory management.  
- [examples/](examples/): Code examples demonstrating constructors, destructors, and `this` in action.  
- [practice_questions/](practice_questions/): Practice problems to reinforce understanding.  

This module provides a structured approach to understanding **object lifecycle management** in C++.
