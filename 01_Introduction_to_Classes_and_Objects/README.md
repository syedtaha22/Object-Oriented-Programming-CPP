# Introduction to Classes and Objects

This module covers the basics of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in C++, focusing on **classes** and **structures**. It introduces the core concepts needed to organize and manage code effectively.  

## Topics Covered

1. **Structures and Classes**: Differences and similarities between structures and classes.  
2. **Defining Members**: Adding attributes (data members) and methods (member functions).  
3. **Encapsulation**: Controlling access to data and functions.  
4. **Abstraction**: Using classes to hide unnecessary implementation details.  
5. **Access Modifiers**: Understanding public, private, and protected members.  
6. **Creating and Using Objects**: Initializing objects, accessing members, and calling methods.  

## Folder Structure  

- [ClassesObjects.md](ClassesObjects.md): Detailed notes on classes and objects.
- [examples/](examples/): Code examples demonstrating class and structure usage.
- [practice_questions/](practice_questions/): Practice questions to reinforce your understanding.

This module is essential for understanding how to work with structures and classes in C++ and serves as the foundation for learning more advanced OOP concepts.
