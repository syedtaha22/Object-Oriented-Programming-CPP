# Object-Oriented Programming Techniques

Welcome to the **Object-Oriented Programming Techniques** repository. This repository contains notes, examples, and practice questions to help students understand the topics covered in the course.  

## Repository Structure

The repository is divided into modules, each focusing on key topics in object-oriented programming. Each module includes explanations, example code, and practice questions to ensure a thorough understanding of the concepts.

### Modules

1. **[Introduction to Classes and Objects](01_Introduction_to_Classes_and_Objects/README.md)**
   - Understanding classes, objects, and encapsulation
   - Access specifiers: `public` and `private`
   - Methods and `get`/`set` functions

2. **[Constructors, Destructors, and the `this` Operator](02_Constructors_Destructors_This_Operator/README.md)**
   - Constructor types: default, parameterized, and copy constructors
   - Copy constructors and deep vs. shallow copy
   - The `this` operator and its uses
   - Destructors and resource management

3. **[Stacks and Queues](03_Stacks_and_Queues/README.md)**
   - Implementing stack and queue ADTs using arrays and linked lists
