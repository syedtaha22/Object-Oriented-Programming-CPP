# Exception Handling

This module introduces **exception handling** in C++, a mechanism for managing runtime errors in a structured and predictable way. By separating error-handling logic from regular code, exceptions make programs more robust, maintainable, and easier to debug.

## Topics Covered

1. **Basics of Exception Handling**
   - What are exceptions?
   - The `try`, `catch`, and `throw` keywords.
   - Stack unwinding and control flow.

2. **Types of Exceptions**
   - Built-in exceptions.
   - User-defined exceptions.
   - Catching multiple exception types.

3. **Best Practices**
   - Exception safety.
   - Resource management (RAII).
   - When to use exceptions vs. error codes.

## Folder Structure

- [BasicExceptionHandling.md](BasicExceptionHandling.md): Introduction to exception syntax, flow, and fundamentals.
- [TypesOfExceptionHandling.md](TypesOfExceptionHandling.md): Explanation of different kinds of exceptions and how to handle them effectively.
- [BestPractices.md](BestPractices.md): Guidelines for writing safe, efficient, and maintainable exception-handling code.
- [examples/](examples/): Code snippets demonstrating exception handling in a variety of scenarios.
- [practice_questions/](practice_questions/practice.md): Exercises to reinforce understanding of exception mechanisms and best practices.

This module builds upon the core programming constructs of **functions**, **control flow**, and **object-oriented design**, helping you write **resilient**, **clean**, and **fault-tolerant** C++ code.
