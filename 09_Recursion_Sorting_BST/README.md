# Recursion, Sorting, and BSTs in C++

This module introduces three foundational topics in C++ programming: **recursion**, **sorting algorithms**, and **binary search trees (BSTs)**. Mastery of these topics is essential for solving complex algorithmic problems, understanding data structures, and writing efficient, readable code.

## Topics Covered

- **Recursive Algorithms**
  - Principles of recursion and base cases
  - Recursive vs. iterative thinking
  - Backtracking techniques (e.g., subset generation, maze solving)

- **Sorting Algorithms**
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Shell Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Analysis of time and space complexity

- **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)**
  - BST properties and usage
  - Insertion and deletion operations
  - Tree traversals: Inorder, Preorder, and Postorder

## Folder Structure

- [RecursionAndBacktracking.md](RecursionAndBacktracking.md): Covers recursive function design and introduces backtracking.
- [SortingAlgorithms.md](SortingAlgorithms.md): Explains common sorting algorithms and their trade-offs.
- [BinarySearchTree.md](BinarySearchTree.md): Introduces BST operations and traversals with examples.

Begin with [RecursionAndBacktracking.md](RecursionAndBacktracking.md) to understand recursive problem-solving, then proceed to sorting techniques and finally to the design and manipulation of binary search trees.
