# Instructions for Lab Submission:

## 1. **File Naming and Submission**:
   - Submit your solution as a zip file named *Lab1_<ERP>.zip*, where `<ERP>` is your ERP number. For example, if your ERP number is 12345, the file should be named *Lab1_12345.zip*.
   - Ensure that the zip file:
     - Contains the following directories:
       - `headers/`: All header files, named as `<class/struct name>.hpp`.
       - `src/`: All implementation files named as `<class/struct name>.cpp`.
       - `main/`: All files with the main function for each task named as *Task<number>.cpp*.
     - Does not include unnecessary files like executables.
     - Does **not** include TEXT files.

## 2. **Code Organization**:
   - Each class or struct used in a task must have its declaration in a `.hpp` file (in the `headers/` directory) and its implementation in a `.cpp` file (in the `src/` directory).
   - The logic and function calls should be written in a separate main file (in the `main/` directory).
   - Ensure that the code structure is modular and adheres to the principles of good software development (e.g., separation of concerns).

## 3. **Code Neatness**:
   - Ensure your code is well-formatted and easy to read. Use proper indentation and meaningful variable names.
   - Include appropriate comments to explain the logic where necessary (especially for functions and complex sections of the code).
   - Add clear explanations where required (or specified) to make the logic of your program easy to follow.

## 4. **Code Compilation and Functionality**:
   - Ensure your code compiles without errors or warnings. You should be able to compile and run your code on any system with a standard C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC).
   - Double-check that the functionality of the program meets the requirements outlined in the task.

## 5. **Additional Instructions**:
   - Do not use any libraries or features that have not been covered in the course material, unless specifically instructed.
   - Make sure your code adheres to the principles of good software development (e.g., modular functions, minimal repetition, and no hardcoding).
   - If you encounter any issues or require clarifications, reach out **before the submission deadline**.

## 6. **Deadline**:
   - Ensure that you submit your lab *on time*, before the deadline. Late submissions will **not** be accepted.
   - Double-check that the zip file is correctly named and contains all necessary files before submitting.

## 7. **Plagiarism Policy**:
   - The work submitted must be entirely your own. Any code or content copied from others (including online sources, classmates, or AI) will result in an automatic **zero** for the task.
