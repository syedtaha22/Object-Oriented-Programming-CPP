# Inheritance and Polymorphism

This module covers two essential **object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts**: **Inheritance** and **Polymorphism**. These principles enable **code reuse**, **hierarchical relationships**, and **dynamic behavior** in C++.

## Topics Covered

1. **Inheritance**  
   - Concept and real-world applications.  
   - Types of inheritance (single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, hybrid).  
   - Access specifiers and their impact on inheritance.  
   - Overriding base class members.  
   
2. **Polymorphism**  
   - Virtual functions and dynamic dispatch.  
   - Concept and real-world applications.  
   - Compile-time vs. run-time polymorphism.  
   - Function overloading and operator overloading.  
   
3. **Type Casting in OOP**  
   - Static and dynamic casting.  
   - Use cases and best practices.  
   
## Folder Structure

- [Inheritance.md](Inheritance.md): Explanation of inheritance, its types, and key concepts.  
- [Virtual_Keyword.md](Virtual_Keyword.md): In-depth explanation of the `virtual` keyword and its role in polymorphism.
- [Polymorphism.md](Polymorphism.md): Detailed overview of polymorphism, including function overloading, overriding, and virtual functions.  
- [static_and_dynamic_casting.md](static_and_dynamic_casting.md): Detailed comparison of static and dynamic casting in C++.
- [examples/](examples/): Code snippets demonstrating inheritance and polymorphism in C++.  
- [practice_questions/](practice_questions/): Exercises to reinforce the concepts.  

This module provides a structured approach to understanding **inheritance** and **polymorphism**, laying the foundation for scalable and maintainable OOP designs.
